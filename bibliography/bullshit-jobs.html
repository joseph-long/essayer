  <p>These days, it’s hard to recall the almost mystical aura with which the
financial sector had surrounded itself in the years leading up to 2008.
Financiers had managed to convince the public—and not just the public, but
social theorists, too (I well remember this)—that with instruments such as
collateralized debt obligations and high-speed trading algorithms so complex
they could be understood only by astrophysicists, they had, like modern
alchemists, learned ways to whisk value out of nothing by means that others
dared not even try to understand. Then, of course, there came the crash, and
it turned out that most of the instruments were scams. Many weren’t even
particularly sophisticated scams. <a class="citation" href="#bullshit-jobs">[Graeber, 2019, chap. 5]</a></p>

<p>Of course, that still hasn’t stopped the physicists, thinking they’ve solved
the secrets of universe, from <a href="https://xkcd.com/793/">flouncing into other fields</a>,

<blockquote>
  <p>The most common complaint among those trapped in offices doing nothing all
day is just how difficult it is to repurpose the time for anything
worthwhile. One might imagine that leaving millions of well-educated young
men and women without any real work responsibilities but with access to the
internet—which is, potentially, at least, a repository of almost all human
knowledge and cultural achievement—might spark some sort of Renaissance.
Nothing remotely along these lines has taken place. Instead, the situation
has sparked an efflorescence of social media (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram,
Twitter): basically, of forms of electronic media that lend themselves to
being produced and consumed while pretending to do something else. I am
convinced this is the primary reason for the rise of social media,
especially when one considers it in the light not just of the rise of
bullshit jobs but also of the increasing bullshitization of real jobs. As
we’ve seen, the specific conditions vary considerably from one bullshit job
to another. Some workers are supervised relentlessly; others are expected to
do some token task but are otherwise left more or less alone. Most are
somewhere in between. Yet even in the best of cases, the need to be on call,
to spend at least a certain amount of energy looking over one’s shoulder,
maintaining a false front, never looking too obviously engrossed, the
inability to fully collaborate with others—all this lends itself much more
to a culture of computer games, YouTube rants, memes, and Twitter
controversies than to, say, the rock ’n’ roll bands, drug poetry, and
experimental theater created under the midcentury welfare state. What we are
witnessing is the rise of those forms of popular culture that office workers
can produce and consume during the scattered, furtive shards of time they
have at their disposal in workplaces where even when there’s nothing for
them to do, they still can’t admit it openly.</p>

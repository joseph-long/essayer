<p>It’s easy to see why Walter Lippmann gets slammed for flagrant elitism.</p>

<p>To be sure, <em>Public Opinion</em> is one momentous book; which other can claim to
not only have coined the term <span class="sc">stereotype</span>, but also the
phrase <span class="sc">the manufacture of
consent</span><sup id="fnref:manufacture-consent" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:manufacture-consent" class="footnote">1</a></sup>? With fortuitous beginnings he points out
that we who live in societies with spheres of influence beyond the direct
experience of our 5 senses, must inevitably act on and react to a <em>mediated</em>
reality, to representations of fickle fidelity to the situation on the ground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its interests
and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens,
ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp.
<a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">[Lippmann, 1922, chap. 3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the situation he wrote of in 1922 seems strangely familiar to our post-2016,
filter bubble consciousness, it is probably because the situation has not
improved in the slightest (read: it’s worse). To situate ourselves a little in
time, 1922 was right about when the TV was busy getting invented, but it wasn’t
really until the world had limped through two world wars that the average
family had a TV set in their home.</p>

<p>So imagine yourself as Lippmann, having ‘gone to school in Boston’, already
writing about such mediation difficulties in an era with just the
(comparatively) staid daily newspaper. No chattering talking heads yakking
their heads off in a box, no frenzied twittering, tiktoking, or For You Feeds,
no sir. Yet administrators were already finding themselves inundated by the
cacophony of the world whose affairs they were in charge of arranging. As for
the average person—citing James Melvin Lee in <em>The History of American
Journalism</em>, “the subject of deepest interest to an average human being is
himself; next to that he is most concerned about his neighbors.” So to this
complicated task of governance over “The Great Society”, Lippmann prescribed
the guidance of experts. Specifically, technical experts, since it was by
“exact measurements and quantitative analysis” that the colossus had grown, and
hence it must be by such “technic” that the colossus be brought under control.
Not all such experts, though, were created equal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet curiously enough, though he knew that he needed help, he was slow to
call in the social scientist. The chemist, the physicist, the geologist,
had a much earlier and more friendly reception. Laboratories were set up
for them, inducements offered, for there was quick appreciation of the
victories over nature. But the scientist who has human nature as his
problem is in a different case. There are many reasons for this: the
chief one, that he has so few victories to exhibit. He has so few,
because unless he deals with the historic past, he cannot prove his
theories before offering them to the public. The physical scientist can
make an hypothesis, test it, revise the hypothesis hundreds of times,
and, if after all that, he is wrong, no one else has to pay the price.
But the social scientist cannot begin to offer the assurance of a
laboratory test, and if his advice is followed, and he is wrong, the
consequences may be incalculable. He is in the nature of things far more
responsible, and far less certain.<sup id="fnref:physicists" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:physicists" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
<a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">[Lippmann, 1922, chap. 25]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost by definition, the “technical expert” who is the best candidate for
bringing the thronging masses under control would be the social scientist. But
nothing is certain for human beings outside of birth, death—and some say taxes.
Humans behave in ways quite unlike the predictable movements of the planets, or
the precise enthalpy of vaporisation of water. Even more troublesome, it is
not, generally speaking, socially acceptable to experiment on human beings as
one does on an inert rock, or an insentient mouse<sup id="fnref:lky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lky" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. But even in the face
of these difficulties, Lippmann believes that the social scientist will come
into their own when they find their reproducible method—starting with wresting
control of the data collection process from the administrator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] The physical scientists achieved their freedom from clericalism by
working out a method that produced conclusions of a sort that could not be
suppressed or ignored. They convinced themselves and acquired dignity, and
knew what they were fighting for. The social scientist will acquire his
dignity and his strength when he has worked out his method. He will do that
by turning into opportunity the need among directing men of the Great Society
for instruments of analysis by which an invisible and most stupendously
difficult environment can be made intelligible.</p>

  <p>[…] To-day the sequence is that the man of affairs finds his facts, and
decides on the basis of them; then, some time later, the social scientist
deduces excellent reasons why he did or did not decide wisely. This ex post
facto relationship is academic in the bad sense of that fine word. The real 
sequence should be one where the disinterested expert first finds and 
formulates the facts for the man of action, and later makes what wisdom he 
can out of comparison between the decision, which he understands, and the 
facts, which he organized. <a class="citation" href="#public-opinion">[Lippmann, 1922, chap. 25]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there exists such a monstrous thing as the disinterested expert in this
world, I should very much like to meet them. How, in the first place, does one
get to become an expert in a subject area if they weren’t particularly
interested in it at all? Humans are always interested parties, even
if—<em>especially</em> if they interject themselves as an apparently neutral third
party in an affair. There is no such thing in this world as an unbiased view,
or an objective set of facts about the social world, especially if, as Lippmann
is recommending here, they were “organized” by a single person with all the
limitations of their own life’s experiences, the filter bubble of their class
and status. <!-- TK: rant on neutrality --></p>

<p>In any case, people certainly aren’t waiting around for the ‘experts’ to ride
to their rescue.<sup id="fnref:2016" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2016" class="footnote">4</a></sup> After all, it is the deified economists of the
Chicago School who have so freely marketed the American economy right into the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/poverty-and-inequality-under-trump-human-rights-under-threat">yawning maw of inequality</a>

      <p>Just to underscore the point here—it is not so much that the
physical scientist is that much smarter or more capable than the social
scientist, it’s that their field of study is just simpler and more
predictable than the study of human beings—much less the study of human
beings in large groups interacting. Drop a physical scientist into a
 non-vacuum, and they are wont to do just as badly

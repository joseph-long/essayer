<blockquote>
  <p>It is only logical, then, that if the genius is going to follow to the letter
the <em>causa sui</em> project, he comes up against one large temptation: to bypass
the woman and the species role of his own body. It is as though he reasons:
“I do not exist to be used as an instrument of physical procreation in the
interests of the race; my individuality is so total and integral that I
include my body in my <em>causa sui</em> project.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This thread of misogyny runs all the way back to the Greeks: “man” as a being
separate from and above women and animals. Well, this exact argument could be
deployed by women against the chains of sexism–except that even to make this
argument requires that derangement (Becker: neurosis) that a human being can
survive in simply the vacuum of their own ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both men reached the same conclusion after the most exhaustive psychological
quest: that at the very furthest reaches of scientific description,
psychology has to give way to “theology”—that is, to a world-view that
absorbs the individual’s conflicts and guilt and offers him the possibility
for some kind of heroic apotheosis. Man cannot endure his own littleness
unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.
Here Rank and Kierkegaard meet in one of those astonishing historical mergers
of thought: that sin and neurosis are two ways of talking about the same
thing—the complete isolation of the individual, his disharmony with the rest
of nature, his hyperindividualism, his attempt to create his own world from
within himself. Both sin and neurosis represent the individual blowing
himself up to larger than his true size, his refusal to recognize his cosmic
dependence. Neurosis, like sin, is an attempt to force nature, to pretend
that the <em>causa-sui</em> project really suffices. In sin and neurosis man
fetishizes himself on something narrow at hand and pretends that the whole
meaning and miraculousness of creation is limited to that, that he can get
his beatification from that.</p>

<p>Trump, Hitler, et al.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, Freud found that the leader allows us to express forbidden
impulses and secret wishes. Redl saw that in some groups there is indeed what
he perfectly calls the “infectiousness of the unconflicted person.” There are
leaders who seduce us because they do not have the conflicts that we have; we
admire their equanimity where we feel shame and humiliation. Freud saw that
the leader wipes out fear and permits everyone to feel omnipotent. Redl
refined this somewhat by showing how important the leader often was by the
simple fact that it was he who performed the “initiatory act” when no one
else had the daring to do it. Redl calls this beautifully the “magic of the
initiatory act.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The important conclusion for us is that the groups “use” the leader sometimes
with little regard for him personally, but always with regard to fulfilling
their own needs and urges. W. R. Bion, in an important recent paper extended
this line of thought even further from Freud, arguing that the leader is as
much a creature of the group as they of him and that he loses his “individual
distinctiveness” by being a leader, as they do by being followers. He has no
more freedom to be himself than any other member of the group, precisely
because he has to be a reflex of their assumptions in order to qualify for
leadership in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is all so neat, this usage of the leader; it reminds us of James Frazer’s
discovery that in the remote past tribes often used their kings as scapegoats
who, when they no longer served the people’s needs, were put to death. These
are the many ways in which men can play the hero, all the while that they are
avoiding responsibility for their own acts in a cowardly way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is forced to address his performance to qualify for goodness to his fellow
creatures, as they form his most compelling and immediate environment, not in
the physical or evolutionary sense in which like creatures huddle unto like,
but more in the spiritual sense. Human beings are the only things that
mediate meaning, which is to say that they give the only human meaning we can
know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and yet</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our interiors feel empty or anguished, our lives valueless, when we see the
inevitable pettinesses of the world expressed through the human beings in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-truth-and-lying">On Truth and Lying</h2>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>With the truth, one cannot live. To be able to live one needs illusions,
not only outer illusions such as art, religion, philosophy, science and
love afford, but inner illusions which first condition the outer [i.e., a
secure sense of one’s active powers, and of being able to count on the
powers of others]. The more a man can take reality as truth, appearance as
essence, the sounder, the better adjusted, the happier will he be… this
constantly effective process of self-deceiving, pretending and blundering,
is no psychopathological mechanism….</p>

    <p>— Otto Rank</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-religion">On religion</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We said earlier that the question of human life is: on what level of illusion
does one live? This question poses an absolutely new question for the science
of mental health, namely: What is the “best” illusion under which to live?
Or, what is the most legitimate foolishness? […] I think the whole question
would be answered in terms of how much freedom, dignity, and hope a given
illusion provides. These three things absorb the problem of natural neurosis
and turn it to creative living.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have to look for the answer to the problem of freedom where it is most
absent: in the transference, the fatal and crushing enslaver of men. The
transference fetishizes mystery, terror, and power; it holds the self bound
in its grip. Religion answers directly to the problem of transference by
expanding awe and terror to the cosmos where they belong.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Best of all, of course, religion solves the problem of death, which no living
individuals can solve, no matter how they would support us. Religion, then,
gives the possibility of heroic victory in freedom and solves the problem of
human dignity at its highest level. The two ontological motives of the human
condition are both met: the need to surrender oneself in full to the rest of
nature, to become a part of it by laying down one’s whole existence to some
higher meaning; and the need to expand oneself as an individual heroic
personality. Finally, religion alone gives hope, because it holds open the
dimension of the unknown and the unknowable, the fantastic mystery of
creation that the human mind cannot even begin to approach, the possibility
of a multidimensionality of spheres of existence, of heavens and possible
embodiments that make a mockery of earthly logic—and in doing so, it relieves
the absurdity of earthly life, all the impossible limitations and
frustrations of living matter.</p>

<p>So much tea packed into one book:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The TL;DR on the “third-world debt crisis” you hear from time to time (but
whose origins never get explained): the OPEC had a glut of money lying
around from the oil crisis in the 70’s, and deposited it in Western banks.
Western banks now had a glut of money they wanted to get interest on, so
they teamed up with the IMF / World Bank and started offering “development
loans” to “developing” countries, agreed upon by the ruling elites of those
countries. That borrowed money didn’t exactly trickle down to the ordinary
people in those countries, but it was still ultimately the ordinary people
who had to repay the principal + interest on those loans via taxes
(surprise, surprise). The net effect being that the outflow of money from
the poorer countries to the rich was actually larger than the inflow, i.e.
the poorer countries of the world were technically, all told, sending
financial aid to the richer countries(’ financial elites).</li>
  <li>The origin myth of money (i.e. that tale they told you about primitives
wanting to barter but not having things of equal value to exchange on hand)
was pretty much a fabrication by Adam Smith et al. They were trying to
justify instituting economics as its own field of study, supposedly
prior to and hence independent from politics or ethics.</li>
  <li>In fact, Smith’s famous “invisible hand”, as well as the anecdote about the
pin factory, both appear to have been <del>lifted</del> uh, <em>inspired</em> by earlier
sources in Islamic philosophy that reached European audiences during the
Enlightenment. (In addition to other such derivative works by Descartes,
Hume, and Kant.)</li>
  <li>Credit as a concept existed before money ever did, often as a way of
arranging social relations within a community.</li>
  <li>There used to be regular “debt-forgiveness decrees” e.g. in Egypt, where
during a debt crisis, everyone’s debts, then recorded on tablets, would get
erased, and the tablets broken. Everyone would get to start over, literally
on a clean slate. The Rosetta Stone—so famous for its key role in the
translation of texts—is actually a record of such a decree by Ptolemy V.</li>
  <li>Money (specifically, coinage) only became important in conjunction with
warfare, whereas credit was more widely used amongst civilians in
peacetime. Which makes sense—if I know where you live, you know where I
live, neither of us is going anywhere any time soon, and we’re not at war
with each other, why bother being so pedantic (not to mention
un-neighbourly) about up-front payments? Coinage, on the other hand, is
important if there’s some marauding army passing through, you don’t trust
the other party one bit, and would rather sooner have nothing more to do
with the other. Graeber dubs this the <em>military-slavery-coinage complex</em>.</li>
  <li>This complex started in what he dubs the Axial Age—the same age in which
Pythagoras, the Buddha, and Confucius were contemporaries (circa 500 BC),
and the major world philosophies/religions arose, in response to this great
rending of social relations due to incessant warfare.</li>
  <li>Interest—usury—was banned / considered immoral under most / all of these
philosophies.</li>
  <li>The Muslim traders were actually the first ones famous for setting up
trading outposts all out across the Indian Ocean, and had somehow all
managed to agree to keep their wars to dry land, reserving the seas for
peaceful commerce.<sup id="fnref:islam-sea" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:islam-sea" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>The colonization of the Americas, specifically the enslavement of Native
Americans in the American gold and silver mines, wouldn’t have been so
profitable were it not for the then insatiable appetite of the dynamic
Chinese market for bullion, and the demand for “eastern luxuries” in (the
rich parts of) Europe. (In fact, prices for silver collapsed in Europe
around that time from over-supply.) Eventually, though, they got tired of
having to export so much bullion that they started the Opium War to try and
settle that balance of payments.</li>
  <li>Your 401K (or equivalent retirement account invested in US government
bonds)? That’s basically you financing US government debt, above and on top
of what you already pay in taxes. And so where does the money come from to
finance the interest on those government loans? ;)</li>

the origins of Islamic cultures in South-east Asian communities. They
don’t teach you much about this in Singapore, despite having what they like
to call a “world-class education system”. <a href="#fnref:islam-sea" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

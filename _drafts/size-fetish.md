[LaJeunesse's tell-all](#google-ir-head-left) about Google's long, slow slide
into becoming Yet Another Big Greedy Co. made for some resigned, depressing
reading. Nothing much new in here of course, for recovering techno-utopians:
giant tech company promises to change the world and bring about a revolution,
just forgot to mention it'd be for the worse.

For someone who remembers the days when Google still coolly and proudly flew
its Don't Be Evil flag high, the lurching decline of that banner—from its motto
(circa 2000), to merely opening its code of conduct (2015, with its
incorporation into Alphabet, Inc.), to its [present
burial](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393)
in the concluding sentence of said code (2018)—nevertheless comes as a
disappointment. Now laid to rest amongst the verbiage, this ex-motto
nevertheless still retains its significance in its phrasing; as Nietzsche
pointed out, one can't be evil without power. The struggle of good against evil
is inherently one of the oppressed against the powerful: "don't be evil" was
apt for when Google was but a small, young upstart against the likes of Yahoo!
in its heyday, but pretty much meaningless for the tech behemoth it is now,
with all the monopoly power it wields over the online advertising world, and
beyond.

The particulars here in this post bear some dwelling upon, I think, to help
shed some light on _how_ organisations—even those starting out with the
best intentions—descend into depravity:

Without the people with the founding vision at the helm, it just gets that much
easier for those with more pedestrian capitalist ambitions to take over. At a
certain size and stature in the market, it becomes hard _not_ to attract the
type of employee that seizes upon the company primarily in its position as
widely acknowledged status symbol; a fetish object, if you'd like—the type of
employee who is prepared to take the company precisely where Wall Street wants
it to go.

In the corridors of the Columbia Center for Career Education hangs a
collection of business-speak motivational posters. The one that I remember to
this day was one that said: "Columbia CCE: not just finance or consulting."

I hope they've remembered to update it to a more modern slogan: "Columbia CCE:
not just finance, consulting, or tech."

What sort of a totem is a company like Google? 

There is nothing so certain in life as death and taxes[^taxes], which makes
both worthy of close examination (cf [this other post on boundary
conditions]({% post_url boundary-conditions %})). Mortal man, doomed to die;
in _Denial of Death_, Ernest Becker points to that strain of thought passed to
us from the Homeric epics of the heroic self, transcending death through famed
deeds that will be remembered through the generations. "Man cannot endure his
own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest
possible level." Such a transcendence is reserved solely for the masculine,
for “Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it
possible for ephemeral ones to procreate,” but since even animals procreate,
and the procreative role of woman anchors man down too to the wild beasts of
the Earth, the only way for man to honourably conquer death is through his
intellect and those faculties he deems to be uniquely human.

  people in the 21st century are such subjects, having no other choice,
  nation-states having now successfully enclosed every last square inch of the
  Earth.

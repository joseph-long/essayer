This thread of misogyny runs all the way back to the Greeks: "man" as a being
separate from and above women and animals. Well, this exact argument could be
deployed by women against the chains of sexism--except that even to make this
argument requires that derangement (Becker: neurosis) that a human being can
survive in simply the vacuum of their own ideas.

## On figureheads and totems

## On religion

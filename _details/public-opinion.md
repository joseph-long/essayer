It's easy to see why Walter Lippmann gets slammed for flagrant elitism.

To be sure, *Public Opinion* is one momentous book; which other can claim to
not only have coined the term <span class="sc">stereotype</span>, but also the
phrase <span class="sc">the manufacture of
consent</span>[^manufacture-consent]? With fortuitous beginnings he points out
that we who live in societies with spheres of influence beyond the direct
experience of our 5 senses, must inevitably act on and react to a *mediated*
reality, to representations of fickle fidelity to the situation on the ground.

> Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its interests
> and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens,
> ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp.

If the situation he wrote of in 1922 seems strangely familiar to our post-2016,
filter bubble consciousness, it is probably because the situation has not
improved in the slightest (read: it's worse). To situate ourselves a little in
time, 1922 was right about when the TV was busy getting invented, but it wasn't
really until the world had limped through two world wars that the average
family had a TV set in their home.

So imagine yourself as Lippmann, having 'gone to school in Boston', already
writing about such mediation difficulties in an era with just the
(comparatively) staid daily newspaper. No chattering talking heads yakking
their heads off in a box, no frenzied twittering, tiktoking, or For You Feeds,
no sir. Yet administrators were already finding themselves inundated by the
cacophony of the world whose affairs they were in charge of arranging. As for
the average person—citing James Melvin Lee in _The History of American
Journalism_, "the subject of deepest interest to an average human being is
himself; next to that he is most concerned about his neighbors." So to this
complicated task of governance over "The Great Society", Lippmann prescribed
the guidance of experts. Specifically, technical experts, since it was by
"exact measurements and quantitative analysis" that the colossus had grown, and
hence it must be by such "technic" that the colossus be brought under control.
Not all such experts, though, were created equal:

Almost by definition, the "technical expert" who is the best candidate for
bringing the thronging masses under control would be the social scientist. But
nothing is certain for human beings outside of birth, death—and some say taxes.
Humans behave in ways quite unlike the predictable movements of the planets, or
the precise enthalpy of vaporisation of water. Even more troublesome, it is
not, generally speaking, socially acceptable to experiment on human beings as
one does on an inert rock, or an insentient mouse[^lky]. But even in the face
of these difficulties, Lippmann believes that the social scientist will come
into their own when they find their reproducible method—starting with wresting
control of the data collection process from the administrator.

If there exists such a monstrous thing as the disinterested expert in this
world, I should very much like to meet them. How, in the first place, does one
get to become an expert in a subject area if they weren't particularly
interested in it at all? Humans are always interested parties, even
if—_especially_ if they interject themselves as an apparently neutral third
party in an affair. There is no such thing in this world as an unbiased view,
or an objective set of facts about the social world, especially if, as Lippmann
is recommending here, they were "organized" by a single person with all the
limitations of their own life's experiences, the filter bubble of their class
and status. <!-- TK: rant on neutrality -->

In any case, people certainly aren't waiting around for the 'experts' to ride
to their rescue.[^2016] After all, it is the deified economists of the
Chicago School who have so freely marketed the American economy right into the
[yawning maw of inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/poverty-and-inequality-under-trump-human-rights-under-threat)
it is now in.

[^physicists]: Just to underscore the point here—it is not so much that the
    physical scientist is that much smarter or more capable than the social
    scientist, it's that their field of study is just simpler and more
    predictable than the study of human beings—much less the study of human
    beings in large groups interacting. Drop a physical scientist into a
     non-vacuum, and they are wont to do just as badly
    ([or worse, make shit up](bullshit-jobs.html#physicists)).

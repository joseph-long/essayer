1.  The "evolutionary series" of band-tribe-chiefdom-state and
    village-town-city-country are very much in dispute here.
1.  People had to be cajoled and coerced into forming permanent agricultural
    settlements that were legible for state appropriation. such agglomeration
    (beyond a certain size?) wasn't such a voluntary measure so much
    as an imposition by the labor requirements and physical limitations of
    state-building. Defection from such states was common.
1.  "Building a wall" (e.g. the "great" one in China) was just as much for
    keeping the barbarians out as it was for enclosing the peasants in so that
    they didn't try to escape the state.
1.  States seem to have been responsible for basically all the ills of modern
    life: the enclosure of the commons[^enclose], extractivist (timber +
    mineral) privatisation of public goods, money, monocultures (easier to
    record and administer for taxation, leading to biodiversity loss, unhealthy
    for humans and non-humans alike), patriarchal households as method of
    social control, population growth (so as to increase available labour for
    agriculture and warfare) and overconcentration in cities (again, for easy
    administration, leading to devastating epidemics)
1.  Swiddening / hunting-gathering is more efficient per unit of labor.
    agriculture is more efficient per unit of land. Early peoples tended to
    have plenty of land and little labor, hence the preference for the former.
    States preferred the latter due to the comparative ease of taxing settled
    lands within a certain radius of its nucleus. This also made agricultural
    settlements easy pickings for raiders. The corollary is also that
    swiddening was preferred by state-evading peoples precisely because it was
    that much easier to just pack up and go if some marauding army came
    through.
1.  Subsistence strategies for state-evaders: hunt and gather foods, plant
    foods that are not so easily razed to the ground by conquering armies (e.g.
    inconspicuous root vegetables like potatoes or yams rather than grains).
1.  When the state demands of taxation / corvée labour / slavery / debt / war
    got too onerous, people could and would literally run for the
    hills[^the-hills]. It's much harder to traverse mountainous terrain, but
    also harder for any pursuers to stay on evaders' trails.
1.  Mountainous regions the world over have this in common: Zomia (including
    Guizhou, Yunan, etc.), the Scottish highlands, Switzerland, the Himalayas
    range, the Appalachian range—all are "shatter zones" where the successive
    waves of refugees from state-centres have collected in "sedimentary
    layers", so to speak, over the centuries.
1.  Tribal identities tend to be very fluid, and state-evading peoples
    themselves tend to play up/down different parts of their ancestries as
    circumstances dictate. Definitive identities tend to be imposed by
    neighbouring states / colonisers for the census, but such identities are
    rarely accurate, if at all, for long. Tribes may not even be genetically
    distinct from the "majority population", as in the case of the orang asli,
    but may rather be a political choice to keep out of the state.
1.  Cultural strategy for state-evaders: stick to orality, lose the texts (and
    writing). Textual permanence allows for entrenchment of hierarchies and
    inequalities, which was exactly what these people were fleeing from in the
    first place.
1.  This fucking gem from Sir Stamford Raffles, revered founder of Singapore
    >   Here [Sumatra] I am the advocate of despotism. The strong arm of power
    >   is necessary to bring men together, and to concentrate them into
    >   societies.… Sumatra is, in great measure, peopled by innumerable petty
    >   tribes, subject to no general government.… At present people are as
    >   wandering in their habits as the birds of the air, and until they are
    >   congregated and organized under something like authority, nothing can
    >   be done with them.
1.  "Ethnicity begins where sovereignty and taxes end."
1.  "States make wars and wars make states."
1.  "All agriculture is a risky proposition."
1.  World religions as state propaganda. e.g. Confucianism



[^the-hills]: I'm guessing this is probably [where that idiom came
    from](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/80685), as repeatedly mentioned
    in the Bible as well.
